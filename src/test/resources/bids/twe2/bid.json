  "description": "The internal service areas face significant pressure to change, with low levels of standardization and digitalization, leaving them unable to meet current and future demands. A digital service portal is intended to create efficient, transparent, and user-friendly processes, unify service quality, reduce administrative workload, and improve employee satisfaction. It will serve as a central access point for all target groups, providing information, chatbot support, and automated routing for requests that cannot be resolved directly. This establishes the foundation for extensive automation of transactional processes and positions the organization for improved performance and future readiness.",
