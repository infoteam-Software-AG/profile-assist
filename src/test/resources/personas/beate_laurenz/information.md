However, not all listed skills are represented in projects (CI/CD, Agile, Git, TypeScript in backend). Individual roles are not clearly distinguished; descriptions are team-focused (“we did X”). Project durations and team sizes are present, but personal contribution and responsibilities are vague. Text could benefit from explicit skill mapping and personal impact statements. Overall, readable and consistent, but still moderate detail rather than high-quality narrative. |
