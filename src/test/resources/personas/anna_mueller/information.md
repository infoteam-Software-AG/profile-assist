Skills listed as keywords only, with no context or proficiency level. Projects lack duration, team size, specific role, or detailed contribution. Certificates are not dated or contextualized. Job title alone does not convey responsibilities. Overall, very shallow narrative, very little to work with for enrichment or verification. Some consistency in formatting, but content quality is very low. |
