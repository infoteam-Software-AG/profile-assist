Project descriptions are one-liners with no duration, team size, methodology, or personal contribution. Skills listed as keywords only, not fully reflected in projects. Certificates lack dates or context. No measurable impact, no narrative detail. Minimal content for enrichment. Some formatting consistency, but overall very poor quality. |
