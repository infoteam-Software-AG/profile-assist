Descriptions are one-line, do not indicate scope, challenges, or achievements. No measurable outcomes or insights on candidate contribution. Minimal context makes enrichment or gap-filling very difficult. Consistency is fine internally, but overall readability and value are low due to vague and sparse content. |
