| 2                         | evaluate after optimisation | 2           | 2                      | 2           | The profile is extremely poorly written. The project descriptions are in mixed German and English, use broken grammar, and read like bullet-point lists with no coherent narrative. Technologies mentioned in skills are only partially reflected in projects, and some skills, like Machine Learnign (misspelled), DevOps, Bash, PowerShell, and Agile, are not demonstrated at all. The candidate’s individual contributions are vague (“Wir hatten ein Team von 3 Leuten”), and measurable impact is minimal or overstated without context. There is a lack of proper technical depth, explanations, or meaningful outcomes. Overall, this is a very low-quality, “poor” profile that would be rated at the bottom tier. |
