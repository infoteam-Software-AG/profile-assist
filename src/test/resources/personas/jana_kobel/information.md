Skills like Azure Functions, Bicep, Ansible, and Azure Sentinel are missing from projects. Some project technologies are not in the skill list (Azure Front Door, Azure Arc, Azure Site Recovery, Azure Backup, Azure Migrate). Personal contributions are mostly team-focused, limiting individual attribution. Readable and consistent, but skill-to-project mapping incomplete. |
