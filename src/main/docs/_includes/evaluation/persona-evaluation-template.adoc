== 1. Test Groups Overview

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Group | Description | Goal of Evaluation

| *A – Poor / Incomplete Personas*
| Minimal or inconsistent data, missing skills, vague project descriptions
| Evaluate robustness: can the model infer missing context, fill gaps, and produce coherent enriched output?

| *B – Average Personas*
| Plausible but generic skills and projects, moderate detail
| Evaluate enrichment quality: can the model polish, enrich, and extract skills accurately without hallucination?

| *C – High-Quality Personas*
| Already detailed, structured, and consistent
| Evaluate refinement: does the model enhance without redundancy or distortion?
|===

== 2. Tester Configuration Fields (per session)

Each tester fills these once per run or per persona batch.

== 4. Evaluation Criteria Reference (for all groups)

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Criteria | Meaning

| *Skill Extraction Accuracy*
| Were relevant skills correctly recognized and categorized?

| *Gap Filling Quality*
| Did the model intelligently infer missing info? (Group A focus)

| *Enrichment Quality*
| Did the model meaningfully add relevant, realistic detail? (Group B focus)

| *Value Preservation*
| Did the model maintain the integrity of strong input? (Group C focus)

| *Readability*
| Is the text fluent, natural, and professional?

| *Consistency*
| Are similar inputs treated similarly in tone and structure?

| *Creativity / Value Add*
| Did the model enhance with useful, believable detail?

| *Precision / Factual Correctness*
| No hallucinations, coherent domain logic
|===

All criteria should be valued between 1 (=poorly done) and 5 (=excellent).
